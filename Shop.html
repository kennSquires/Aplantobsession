            <p>First of all, thank you for taking the time to check out our plant shop page, <strong>A Plant
                    Obsession</strong>!
                We are a local plant business that is based in Lethbridge, Alberta; we have been running our business
                from home for about a year. Our main goal as
                a business is to excite and educate people about house plants, by selling plants, cuttings and providing
                information with a personal touch; unlike big box stores
            </p><br><br>
            With our store just starting out, we are currently just running our shop through social media such as
            Facebook and Instagram. Our platforms provide plenty of resources for plant lovers such as information on
            how to care for plants, updates on our collection and current plants we have for sale. With our resources at
            the moment,
            we can ship anywhere in Canada; if you are located close to Lethbridge, Alberta we like to personally hand
            drop off the products.
            <br><br>

                <p>From a young age, plants have always intrigued me whether it was gardening with my grandma or
                    watering my mom’s plants around the house.
                    As I lived on my own, I noticed that I couldn’t help myself and kept bringing a plant home every
                    time I stepped out of the house; my love and collection for plants grew fast. With that love and
                    passion for plants,
                    Tara and I decided to take the step and pursue opening a small business. I am thrilled to meet and
                    help fellow plant lovers with taking care of and buying plants; as well as the opportunity to work
                    with my best friend!

                <h3><strong>Tara Benfell</strong></h3>
                <p>My love for plants stemmed from working at a Garden Centre part time, I found the routine of caring
                    for the plants calming and grounding.
                    While working at the garden center I had the ability to learn so much about the varieties of
                    different plants and environmental conditions for plants to thrive.
                    Although one of my favorite aspects of plants is the interior design element they have when it comes
                    to designing; plants can make the home feel so light and tropical, while being a statement piece! I
                    really look forward to pursuing a career in building a plant shop that provides a welcoming, helping
                    hand for plant lovers!
