                <h2><strong>Fiddle Leaf Fig</strong><br>(Ficus lyrata)</h2>
                <p>Fiddle Leaf figs are currently a popular trend in the plant community because they are seen as
                    statement plants for modern interior décor.
                    With beauty comes pain, and fiddle leaf figs are known to be a pain to care for. Although once their
                    care routine is understood, they can be a great plant to maintain, and watch them grow quickly when
                    they are happy.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Care Level: Difficult<br><br>Mature Size for Indoors: 2-10 ft.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="container wrapper">
            <p><strong>Watering:</strong> Fiddle leaf figs prefer to be watered weekly or every ten days;
                make sure that the first two inches of the soil is dry before watering. If the watering schedule is not
                consistent, it can lead to the plant developing red dots on the leaves or even dying.
                Please note that the plant's environment could affect the watering schedule, so always check the soil
                before watering.
            </p><br><br>

            <p><strong>Sunlight:</strong> There are not too many plants that enjoy direct sunlight but Ficus lyrata are
                one of the plants that absolutely love it!
                The plant can tolerate up to five hours of direct light; which can help encourage the plant to develop
                new growth.
                It is usually recommended to have the placed close to a south or west facing window for the best
                results.
            </p><br><br>

            <p><strong>Humidity/Temperature:</strong> The ideal humidity level for Ficus lyrata is in between 30-65%. If
                the plant's environment is on the dryer side, you may need to provide extra humidity by misting the
                plant or placing a humidifier in the location.
                It is also recommended to purchase a humidifier detector to monitor the humidity levels. For the plant
                to thrive in its conditions, it is usually recommended to have its environment at a temperature between
                15-30 Celsius. At that temperature it will allow the plant to think it is in the right condition to grow
                all year round.
                It will also prevent it from dying; anything colder could risk losing the plant.
            </p><br><br>

            <p><strong>Fertilizer needs:</strong> fertilizing is essential for plants and their growth; it provides the
                plant with certain nutrients to develop healthy and dense foliage.
                Any type of boost from fertilizer is beneficial for the Fiddle leaf fig, although they do perform better
                on a fertilizer with a 3-1-2 N-P-K ratio (3% nitrogen, 1% phosphorus, 2% potassium) the numbers will be
                displayed on the package of the fertilizer.
                Depending on the type of fertilizer will determine how often to fertilize; if using a pellet form it
                will only need to be done every few months. While liquid fertilizers will usually have instructions on
                how often to do it, it is usually recommended to use it every two weeks.
            </p><br><br>

            <p><strong>Toxicity to pets:</strong> Fiddle leaf figs can be mildly toxic to pets if the plant is
                indigested. They can show signs of oral irritation, drooling, etc.;
                Call your veterinarian if you are to see any of those signs. Please make sure to keep the plant at a
                location where your pet cannot reach it if they have a bad habit of eating plants.
            </p><br><br>

            <div class="textbox3">
                <p><strong>Extra Care Tips:</strong> as stated earlier, Fiddle leaf figs can be a precise plant to care
                    for. So, we wanted to share some extra tips our company has learned over the years to successfully
                    grow a fiddle leaf fig.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Wiping the leaves with a damp paper towel and a small amount of dish soap:</strong> this
                    extra step will benefit your Ficus lyrata. They love having clean leaves; if there is dust build up,
                    it can prevent your plant from taking in enough light to provide for its new growth.
                    It also prevents any bugs developing on your plant; dish soap works as a great deterrent for most
                    house bugs. We have been doing this once a month and have seen improvement in the foliage of our
                    fiddle leaf figs; more dense and greener foliage!
                </p>

                <p><strong>Rotating the pot:</strong> With the plant being in direct light it tends to move towards the
                    light quite quickly; if it does not get rotated the stem will start to bend and result in your Ficus
                    lyrata not having a sturdy base.
                    We tend to slightly rotate our Fiddle leaf figs every watering; so, about every two weeks.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Repotting:</strong> it is hard to give an exact time of when to repot your fiddle leaf fig;
                    because they grow at different rates due to the environment, they are in. Although it is recommended
                    to only repot their ‘growing’ season; during springtime. Repotting in the right weather conditions
                    will help your Ficus lyrata recover from potential shock. Your new pot should not be any bigger than
                    2-4" than your previous pot it was in.
                    Once you have repotted your Ficus lyrata make sure to give it a generous amount of water. We have
                    found that repotting our Fiddle leaf figs every two years has been beneficial for the environment it
                    is in.

                <h2><strong>Rubber Plant</strong><br>(Ficus Elastica)</h2>
                <p>Looking for a plant with large shiny leaves, wider color selection and low maintenance, look no
                    further!
                    The rubber plant is an easy to care for plant that can bring great character to any room; whether
                    you
                    are looking for hues of ruby or something dark.
                    Another great feature of the Ficis Elastica is the easy ability to watch new growth flourish with
                    little
                    attention.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Care Level: Easy<br><br>Mature Size for Indoors: 2-10 ft.</p>
            </div>
            <img src="images/rubberplant.png" alt="Rubber Leaf">
        </div>
        <div class="container wrapper">
            <p><strong>Watering:</strong> Although the rubber plant is quite forgiving when it comes to care, it can be
                fussy when it comes to the moisture level in the soil; not too wet and not too dry!
                It is recommended to water the plant every seven to fourteen days, depending on the humidity conditions
                within the environment. A good way to indicate whether the plant needs to be watered is checking the
                first
                inch of soil, if it is dry then it is a good indicator to water the plant.
                Do not worry though, if any errors are made with the watering schedule; rubber figs are hardy and can
                easily
                bounce back.
            </p><br><br>

            <p><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Rubber figs prefer bright indirect light for the best growing results; which
                tends
                to be a south or west facing window.
                Although they can tolerate lower light levels but expect a slower rate when it comes to growth of the
                plant.
                If the plant were to receive direct sunlight it could have the consequences of burning the leaves.
            </p><br><br>

            <p><strong>Humidity/Temperature:</strong> A great characteristic of the Ficus Elastica is that humidity
                levels
                do not seem to affect them as much.
                Although for keeping any tropical plant happy, it is recommended to have humidity levels between 45-60%.
                While the temperature in your environment should never be lower than 20 degrees Celsius; not meeting the
                required conditions could result in the plant dying.
                For the best results we propose purchasing a humidifier and temperature detector for reading the
                environmental conditions.
            </p><br><br>

            <p><strong>Fertilizer needs:</strong> It is usually recommended to fertilize rubber plants every 4-6 weeks
                using
                a liquid fertilizer;
                if you use pellets make sure to fertilize the plant less often. If the plant is over fertilized it can
                lead
                to it burning or losing the leaves.
                Fertilizer properties that contain 24-8-16 N-P-K ratio (24% nitrogen, 8% phosphorus, 16% potassium) will
                be
                the most beneficial for optimal growth.
            </p><br><br>

            <p><strong>Toxicity to pets:</strong> Ficus Elastica can be toxic to pets, either by indigestion or even
                skin
                contact. It can result in dermatitis, excessive drooling, oral irritation and vomiting; Call your
                veterinarian if you are to see any of those signs.
                Please make sure to keep the plant at a location where your pet cannot reach it if they have a bad habit
                of
                playing with plants.
            </p><br><br>

            <div class="textbox3">
                <p><strong>Extra Care Tips:</strong> Although the plant is easy to care for, giving them some extra care
                    can
                    go a long way; here are some tricks we have learned!
                </p>
                <p><strong>Wiping the leaves with a damp paper towel and a small amount of dish soap:</strong> This
                    extra
                    step will benefit your rubber plant. They love having clean leaves; if there is dust build up, it
                    can
                    prevent your plant from taking in enough light to provide for its new growth.
                    It also prevents any bugs developing on your plant; dish soap works as a great deterrent for most
                    house
                    bugs. We have been doing this once a month and have seen improvement in the foliage; more dense and
                    greener leaves!
                </p>

                <p><strong>Potting conditions:</strong> Ficus Elastica can develop root rot if they are getting watered
                    too
                    much. An effective way to avoid root rot is providing the plant with a well-draining soil; this can
                    be
                    achieved by using an indoor potting mix with bark and charcoal mixed in.
                    As well as using a terracotta pot (because the material allows the pot to dry out quicker compared
                    to
                    ceramic or plastic potting) or finding a pot with efficient drainage.

                <h2><strong>Weeping Fig</strong><br>(Ficus benjamina)</h2>
                <p>Weeping figs are another well-known statement piece, like their family member; Fiddle Leaf Figs.
                    Ficus benjamina are known for their dark bark stems and oval shaped leaves; as well as their ability
                    to

            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="container wrapper">
            <p><strong>Watering:</strong> Weeping figs prefer to have a consistent moisture level in their soil;
                although be
                aware of the possibility of over-watering the plant.
                These plants are more prone to root rot; which can lead to an unhealthy or dead plant. It is usually
                recommended to water every five to seven days; an effective way to determine is by checking to see if
                the
                first inch of the soil is dry.
                A reminder that everyone's water schedule can vary due to the environment the plant is in.
            </p><br><br>
            <p><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Ficus benjamina enjoys an environment that entails plenty of indirect
                sunlight; if
                the light is too direct, it could result in burning the leaves.
                Weeping figs can withstand lower light levels as well but please note it may take longer to see growth
                and
                the plant may require more fertilizer.
            </p><br><br>
            <p><strong>Humidity/Temperature:</strong> Although weeping figs are not too fussy when it comes to their
                light
                source, they are quite demanding when it comes to humidity and temperature levels.
                They prefer to have a humidity level between 50-80% and should not reach a temperature lower than 20
                degrees
                Celsius; not meeting the required conditions could result in the plant losing its leaves or ability to
                stay
                alive.
                It is recommended to have a moist and warm spot for your weeping fig; for best results we propose to
                purchase a humidifier and temperature detector for reading the environmental conditions.
            </p><br><br>
            <p><strong>Fertilizer needs:</strong> Weeping figs need consistent fertilizing to flourish as indoor plants.
                It is usually recommended to fertilize (with liquid fertilizer) the plant at least once a month during
                its
                growing period; which is during the summertime.
                Then only every two months during the other seasons. For the best results with fertilizing,
                it is recommended to use the fertilizer ratio; 3-1-2 N-P-K ratio (3% nitrogen, 1% phosphorus, 2%
                potassium),
                this information can be found on the back of the bottle.
            </p><br><br>
            <p><strong>Toxicity to pets:</strong> F. benjamina can be toxic to pets, either by indigestion or even skin
                contact.
                It can result in dermatitis, excessive drooling, oral irritation and vomiting;
                Call your veterinarian if you are to see any of those signs. Please make sure to keep the plant at a
                location where your pet cannot reach it if they have a bad habit of playing with plants.

                <p><strong>Extra Care Tips:</strong> With extra love, time and secret tips can result in a beautiful
                    weeping
                    fig; so, we thought to share some!
                </p>
                <p><strong>Creating a fuller tree:</strong> Everyone loves to see a plant full of green leaves and
                    branches,
                    although the plant may not grow like that naturally.
                    As mentioned earlier, weeping figs are easy plants to train to ornamental shape.
                    A technique we have learned is called notching; it is when you notch the main stem with scissors or
                    a
                    blade.
                    For best results, notch the stem close to a node (bulb looking figure on stem, this is usually where
                    new
                    growth comes from!)
                    Once a node is located, give a generous cut into the plant. This will encourage the plant to grow a
                    new
                    branch; within a few weeks there should be new growth! Fun fact: this technique can be done on most
                    plants!!
                </p>
                <p><strong>Rotating the pot:</strong> With the plant being in a brighter location it tends to move
                    towards
                    the light quite quickly; if it does not get rotated the stem will start to bend and result in your
                    Weeping Fig not having a sturdy base.
                    Rotating the plant will allow the plant to grow in a straighter direction; we slightly rotate the
                    pot
                    every watering session.
